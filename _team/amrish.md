is a doctoral student in the Department of History at Johns Hopkins University and is a translator/transcriber for the Keywords for Black Louisiana project. He researches the history of religious difference, religious encounters, and pre-modern structures of racial difference in early modern Spain and the Mediterranean Sea. Currently he is interested in interrogating the social and theological category of ‘apostasy,’ especially as it related to cristiano viejos (old Christians) who were captured by Muslim corsairs, coerced into converting to Islam, and sought reintegration back into Spanish Catholic society from the Spanish Crown and Inquisition. Amrish is also a member of the 2023-2024 cohort for the Stern Center’s Graduate Student Curatorial Fellowship program.
