is an Associate Director at the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins University. She works with two amazing teams of research librarians, curators, and archivists to support faculty and students in their research, teaching, and learning. Prior to joining Hopkins, she served as Deputy Director of MedChi, The Maryland State Medical Society, where she oversaw a medical library and history of medicine collection, and managed various health policy initiatives.  She has also held curatorial positions at the Maryland Center for History and Culture, and the D.C. History Center.

Her research focuses on how faculty incorporate primary sources into their research and teaching, as well as the impact that working with primary sources has on undergraduate work. She is looking forward to exploring these questions with the research corpus generated by K4BL.

She received her B.A. in Humanistic Studies from Johns Hopkins University, and her M.A. in History and a certificate in museum studies from the University of Delaware.  She also holds a masterâ€™s in library science from the University of Maryland.
