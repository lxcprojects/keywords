is an Associate Professor of History at Simon Fraser University and previously taught at the University of California, Berkeley; Dickinson College; Macalester College; and the University of Minnesota. Dr. Spear’s research expertise includes early North American history; gender & sexuality; and comparative colonization, slavery, and race.  

Spear’s first book, *Race, Sex, and Social Order in Early New Orleans* (Johns Hopkins Press, 2009), is a critical contribution to the study of race and gender in Louisiana colonial history. In it, she brings together archival evidence from three different languages and the most recent and respected scholarship on racial formation and interracial sex to explain why free people of color became a significant population in the early days of New Orleans and to show how authorities attempted to use concepts of race and social hierarchy to impose order on a what they decided to be was a disorderly society. She recounts and analyzes the major conflicts that influenced New Orleanian culture: legal attempts to impose racial barriers and social order, political battles over propriety and freedom, and cultural clashes over both place and progress. This research challenges formerly prevailing academic assumptions and moves the racial formation away from cultural and political discourses toward social histories.  

For her impact on the field, Dr. Spear is the winner of the 2009 Kemper and Leila Williams Prize in Louisiana History from the Historic New Orleans Collection and the Louisiana Historical Association.
