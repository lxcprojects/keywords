She earned a M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane and holds undergraduate degrees in Art History and Interdisciplinary Art (dual emphasis in Visual Art and Theatre) from Seattle University. From 2021-2022, Kaillee was the recipient of a U.S. Dept. of Education Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship in Haitian Creole. In 2022-2023, she was the sole recipient of the William J.

Kaillee works as an Associate Editor on the Spanish Language Team for the Keywords Project; additionally, she works as a curatorial assistant at the Newcomb Art Museum and as an archival assistant and metadata specialist for the Stone Center for Latin American Studies. Kaillee’s PhD dissertation, entitled “When I Am Not Here, *Estoy Allá*: Visualizing Expansive Space-Time in Caribbean Diasporic Memory,’’ places the work of five prominent Caribbean diasporic artists–María Magdalena Campos-Pons, La Vaughn Belle, Firelei Báez, Alberta Whittle, and Deborah Jack–in direct conversation with each other, tracing a thread of multivalent memory keeping.
