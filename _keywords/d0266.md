comments: This document is short (just 5 pages), and I have only added one keyword
  so far ("sale"), because I want to go back after the initial transcription is done
  to make sure I understand the nature of the sale and/or what kinship ties might
  have been present between Nanette (a free Black woman) and Maria Juana (an enslaved
  woman) to compel the sale.
