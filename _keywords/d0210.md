abstract: Raphaël Bernard a free Negro who’s been hired in France by Dumanoir complains
  that Dumanoir does not fulfill his promises and also treats him with rigor, depriving

  expense and to have a trunk now detained at the Chaouachas returned to him. [A notice
  was sent to Dumanoir to appear next day without fail]
