abstract: "Raphaël Bernard a free Negro who’s been hired in France by Dumanoir complains
  that Dumanoir does not fulfill his promises and also treats him with rigor, depriving
  him of his due salary and clothing. He asked to be sent back to France at Dumanoir
  expense and to have a trunk now detained at the Chaouachas returned to him. \r\n\r\n[A
  notice was sent to Dumanoir to appear next day without fail]"
