comments: Very interesting reference to Dominique, the father and a cook, being sent
  to France to serve in the "Cour du Roy." But again...really struggling with the
  script... The rest of the family is denoted on the colonial docs site as "(Salmon
  - Rauget) Unidentified family" and "(Salmon - Raguet) Dominique"
