abstract: In Africans in Colonial Louisiana, Dr. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall argues this
  document offers the first Gulf Coast reference to gumbo ("un Gombeau") in the archive.ⁱ
  This is the testimony of Mama "Julie" Comba,ⁱⁱ a fifty year old négresse, an African
  woman of the Mandinga Nation who lived in the Hospital for the Poor (L'Hôpital des
  Pauvres) and was enslaved to the Capuchin priests. Mama Comba appears before the
  French Superior Council in this, her second interrogation, as a result of the arrest
  of two runaways, the nègre Cézar, and the nègre Louis, called Foy (dit Foÿ). The
  runaways were caught and accused of murder, but ultimately charged with public drunkenness,
  theft and firing weapons into the air (no one was killed), and with being fugitives.
  Mama Comba was interrogated because she hosted a feast that Cézar and Louis were
  guests at, bringing with them a pig that Louis allegedly stole and that the guests
  all took part in cooking and eating. The document below is drawn from part of Mama
  Comba's testimony.
