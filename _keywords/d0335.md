abstract: Part 2 (see related doc) of interrogation of Jeannot, a man enslaved to
  Leonard, the neighbor of the recently missing (or killed) Corbin. Jeannot identifies
  himself in the previous document as a thirty seven year old of the Bambara nation.
  He continues from the previous document to summarize the violence he experienced
  at the hands of his enslaver Leonard and his wife. Jeannot responds to questions
  stating that he does not know who killed Corbin, that he was at a gathering ("badinage")
  at Sir Corbin's place two months before his death but that he did not take place
  in the banter/activity/foolery ("il n'y badinoit point") there, that there were
  "des chansons negres" in the Fon language sung at this badinage but that he could
  not understand them because he does not speak the language. Asked about other spiritual
  or religious practices such as pouring water or alcohol or putting rats on Corbin's
  property, but Jeannot denies participating in them, having been working with his
  enslaver. Asked if there were runaways around at the time of Corbin's death to which
  Jeannot said that fifteen days after Corbin's death "les negres de Livet furent
  marons." Asked about his own maronnage, to which he admits to running away for about
  eight days five weeks ago because his mistress threatened to bring him to the city
  to be punished.
