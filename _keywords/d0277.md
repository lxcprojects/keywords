abstract: 'An enslaved man named Pierrot was sold to enslaver Michèl Brosset by Claude
  Boisson ("tailladier en cette ville," tool maker in this city) and his wife, Magdelaine
  Chenier, who had acquired Pierrot as a piece d''inde from the Company of the Indies.
  However, Pierrot went missing after having gone maroon. Boisson and Chenier promise
  to catch Pierrot for Brosset in exchange for cash upon delivery, which they succeed
  in accomplishing. '
