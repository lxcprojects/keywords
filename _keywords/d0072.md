abstract: Petition on the succession of the estate of Coustilhas from the Administrator
  of Vacant Successions. Document recites that the Administrator learned from Estienne
  de La Lande Dalcour (who leased Coustilhas' plantation) that an enslaved man named
  Hypolite, who was enslaved to Coustilhas and therefore part of the estate in question,
  has suffered over the course of the past eight months from a venereal disease (syphilis?
  according to LA Historical Quarterly). Petition was made to sell Hypolite rather
  than spend the money to care for him. Hypolite was sold to Francois Seguier. This
  document is part of a series of documents related to the succession of the estate
  of Coustilhas.
