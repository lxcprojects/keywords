# Summary
To seek treatment for his infection, a free *nègre* named Pierre Almanzor sought help from the king’s doctor. Exhausting other resources, Almanzor depended on Prat to cure him. Pierre Almanzor negotiated an agreement so that once he became healthy again he would work for five years for Doctor Prat without wages in return for the treatment he received.

*negre* 
Engagement  
To *Mr* Prat 

(2004.) 
F<sup>o</sup>. S 

(7960.) 

[Before the Council] Pierre Almanzor[^i] himself, 
free *nègre*,* finding himself afflicted by a  
venereal  
disease[^ii] and [it] being essential, because of all the  
symptoms, 
to cure it with the great remedy [mercury][^ii], 
declared to us 
that although he does not have enough [money] to 
be treated, he nevertheless desires this, without a 
doubt, even given the risk of dying[;] 
and for this purpose he has committed himself 
voluntarily and without 
constraint to serve *Monsieur* Prat, doctor of the 
king,  
for five years either as a cook or in any 
other capacity in which He will be able to make 
himself useful, except  
working with the axe and on the land, and this, in 
return for the  
time and interval of five years allotted and 
completed; 
which will run once he is completely cured, during 
which time *Monsieur*  
Prat will maintain him as befits his  
position, by which he obliges himself to treat, 
medicate, and feed him and to 
provide him all the remedies, food and utensils 
which will be necessary for him during his illness 
and give him all his care in order to attempt to cure 
him 
completely, such as they have agreed, promising,  
obliging, and renouncing, made and approved in 
New 
Orleans 
in the notary’s office, the year one thousand seven 
hundred and thirty-seven, the second of 
March, [in the] presence of *Sieurs* François 
Gautreau [page torn] [store guard] 
of the king and Couturier, witnesses residing there, 
and the aforementioned Almanzor declared not 
knowing how [page 
Torn] [to write] nor to sign, 
in accordance with the ordinance.

## Notes

[^i]: The name Almanzor potentially signals Pierre Almanzor’s connection to the Islam faith. If Almanzor is understood as a cognate of “al-Mansur,” this Arabic name refers to he who was chosen by God.  

[^ii]: By the time the *Académie Française* published the fourth edition of their dictionary in 1762, the word remède included a line for *grand remède* which it defined as “mercury, which is given to cure venereal diseases.” See the *Dictionnaire de l’Académie Française* 4ème édition, t.2, (1762).
