abstract: Enslaver Chaperon declared that on July 28th, 1739 while he was away from
  his plantation in town on business, three enslaved people absconded from his plantation
  and have not been seen or captured since. They were Antoine "Negre Bambara," his
  wife Fauchon "du nation Senegal," and Vulcain, also of the Senegal nation, who escaped
  with them despite having "les jambes coup√©." They escaped the plantation, according
  to Chaperon, with "un mulatre Espagnol" who stole a boat from his enslaver Gonzalez.
