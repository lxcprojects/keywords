abstract: Enslaver Chaperon grants power of attorney to Destrehan in order to recapture
  fugitive slaves seen in Havana. Although Chaperon does not name the enslaved people
  in this document, he references his Nov 7, 1739 declaration of runaway slaves (when
  Antoine, Fauchon and Vulcain escaped with "un mulatre Espagnol"). Chaperon declared
  that one of the three runaways (Vulcain, "lequel Esclave ayant les jambes coupee
  a Et√© Reconnu) was recognized in Havana by other enslaved people from Louisiana
  who saw and spoke to him. Since Destrehan was returning to Cuba for business, Chaperon
  granted Destrehan power of attorney in collaboration with Mr. Bloquin, the French
  Consul in Cuba, to recapture Vulcain and potentially Antoine and Fauchon.
