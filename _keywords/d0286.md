abstract: An enslaved man, Biron of the Bambara nation, is interrogated by the Superior
  Council for having run away from his enslaver and for resisting his recapture. This
  record highlights not only the violence of the French system of slavery, but also
  the limited rights afforded to enslaved people as well as the legal apparatus to
  enforce that enslavement while it was being developed in Louisiana.
