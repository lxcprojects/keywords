crime-punishment,Crime & Punishment,crime & punishment,"The concept of ""crime and punishment"" within Black studies, particularly in the context of Black Louisiana, is explored through historical documents and legal records which reveal a harsh and often violent system of justice that disproportionately targeted enslaved and free Black individuals. They also highlight the systemic nature of racial oppression embedded in laws like the Code Noir.

The Code Noir, or ""Black Code,"" was a set of laws governing the conduct, treatment, and punishment of enslaved people in French colonies, including Louisiana. Enacted in 1724, it outlined the legal framework for slavery and provided guidelines for the punishment of enslaved individuals. As described by Donald Everett, “ The purpose of the original Code Noir was to control the increasing number of slaves in the colony. Harsh restrictions
were imposed on this servile group to prevent insurrections…” This legal code was instrumental in maintaining the brutal system of slavery and ensuring the control of enslaved populations through severe penalties.

Examining specific cases provides a clearer picture of how these laws were applied. For instance, a murderous assault on Picard, who was a cook, by Chaume, a white Creole soldier, and the theft accusations against ""the negro Andre"" show the racial disparities in handling criminal cases. Another document reports the condemnation of ""un negre"" for the murder of his wife, showing the severe consequences faced by Black individuals.

Documents that surround the case of Titus, an enslaved man repeatedly running away from the Pellerin plantation, illustrate the severity of punishments under the law. Titus ran away multiple times and was pursued with the brutal forceof the Code Noir.

Punishment often included severe physical mutilations, as seen in the case of Guela, who was found guilty of repeated marronage, which was the act of running away from an enslaver. His punishment included the severing of both ears and branding with the fleur de lys, another stark example of the brutal acts allowed under the Code Noir.

The overarching theme in these documents is the relentless and often brutal enforcement of laws designed to control and punish enslaved and free Black individuals. The legal system in Louisiana, governed by the Code Noir, was a tool of oppression that ensured the subjugation of Black people through severe and often inhumane punishment.

fugitivity,Fugitivity,fugitivity,"Fugitivity is a keyword in Black studies that captures the physical, metaphysical, armed, and everyday resistance of enslaved Africans and their allies against any and all aspects of enslavement. Rashauna Johnson, describing the ""slave space"" that was New Orleans, points to the specific geography of the region as lesson in fugitivity: ""Nonetheless, enslaved persons appropriated the places assigned them toward their own ends, a point that broadens the received gendered geographies of slave resistance. Because New Orleans was an important port city, it offered a diffuse set of pathways for escape – and recapture. If the politics of place could oppress, slaves reasoned, movement could also become an avenue to freedom. The connectedness that made the city’s location so desirable to merchants and imperial officials – its land passageways, river outlets, and Atlantic access – gave runaways an array of escape options. The fugitives redefined themselves in local “geographies of resistance,” or fled to other parts of the Atlantic World."" (Johnson, Slavery's Metropolis). 

However, fugitivity is a term encompassing more than marronage (which is the act of absconding from enslavers and being out of reach of slaveholding authorities, even if temporary). Fugitivity describes active and intentional resistance, as well as the acts of imagination and refusal that Africans and people of African descent engaged in against slaveholders gendered racial capitalistic regime. 

Fred Moten writes: “What's at stake is fugitive movement in and out of the frame, bar, or whatever externally imposed social logic—a movement of escape, the stealth of the stolen that can be said, since it inheres in every closed circle, to break every enclosure. This fugitive movement is stolen life, and its relation to law is reducible neither to simple interdiction nor bare transgression. Part of what can be attained in this zone of unattainability, to which the eminently attainable ones have been relegated, which they occupy but cannot (and refuse to) own, is some sense of the fugitive law of movement that makes black social life ungovernable, that demands a para-ontological disruption of the supposed connection between explanation and resistance.""

fungibility,Fungibility,fungibility,"Fungibility refers to the exchange, typically of a commodity or good, for another thing of approximately the same value. As a keyword, it describes the treatment of enslaved people of African descent who are treated as products that can be purchased, sold, bartered and tradedThis quality of being a replaceable and inexhaustible commodity influenced ahistorical narrative that defended the practice of slavery in the United States and attempted to strip enslaved peoples of their personhood and autonomy. Writing on fungibility, the scholar Saidiya Hartman notes that “... the fungibility of the commodity makes the captive body an abstract and empty vessel vulnerable to the projection of others’ feelings, ideas, desires, and values; and, as property, the dispossessed body of the slave is the surrogate for the master’s body since it guarantees his disembodied universality and acts as the sign of his power and dominion.” Despite this, the archive contains stories that attest to the ability of enslaved people to reassert their humanity even in the midst of dehumanizing conditions.",,"Diouf, Sylviane A. “Chapter 2: African Maroons.” Slavery’s Exiles: The Story of the American Maroons, New York University, New York, NY, 2016, pp. 58.

girlhood,Girlhood,girlhood,"Girlhood is a keyword for Black Louisiana that captures the experiences, struggles, and resilience of young Black girls in the context of enslavement and racial oppression. The historical documents detailing the lives of these girls reveal a complex narrative of growth, resistance, and survival within a system designed to dehumanize them.

Girlhood in this context is not just a stage of life but a site of resistance and agency. Crystal Lynn Webster states: “Black children, especially girls, faced criminalization in the earliest manifestations of criminal disciplines and prison practices. The youngest child ever executed in the United States was a black girl… Black girls received extreme criminal convictions beyond execution including lifetime imprisonment and were disproportionately represented in juvenile reformatories.” Despite the harsh realities of enslavement, young Black girls like Maria Juana, Carlota, and Marie Jeanne engaged in everyday acts of defiance and resilience. These acts ranged from legal petitions for manumission, as seen in the case of Jeanneton and her daughter Marie Jeanne, to the tragic instances of resistance that ended in severe punishment, like Carlota being tried for arson. In the lives of these young girls, we see this fugitive movement in their efforts to resist the confines of their imposed social and legal status.

Girlhood is also a a space of both vulnerability and strength. It includes the defiant acts that young Black girls used to gain autonomy and resistance against systemic racial and gendered oppression. Through their stories, Keywords for Black Louisiana draws on Black studies insights to better understand the individual and communal acts of resistance that defined their lives.

kinship,Kinship,kinship,"Keywords for Black Louisiana views ""kinship"" and the battle for kin as central to Black life in the New World. Kinship is the glue that knit Africans together in Gulf Coast Louisiana. Building and rebuilding fictive, chosen, and biological kin that reshaped bonds broken through the slave trade and the forced relocations of bondage in the New World occupied Africans and people of African descent from the moment of their initial capture on the content to the end of their lives. 

Larry Powell writes: ""Few aspects of African tradition were felt more strongly by slaves fresh from the homeland than a commitment to kinship. Severed from bloodlines, they invented new family ties on the spot. Fictive kinship was one type. Slaves acquired new siblings and new elders. But these arrangements were ad hoc and informal, anchored in nothing more solid than the sands of sentiment.

Gender, age, and reproductive capacity played an important role in kinship relations and rebuilding kinship and community. As Jessica Marie Johnson writes, ""Understanding the role intimacy and kinship played in black women’s lives highlights black women’s everyday understanding of freedom as centered around safety and security for themselves and their progeny. Safety, particularly safety from intimate violence, and security lay at the heart of decisions to secure or reject patrons, partners, lovers, and other kin. Black women’s intimacy with individuals ranged along the spectrum of coerced to strategic, from fraternal to sexual. Determined to build community and make generations, imagining futures that were, if not beyond bondage, at least buttressed against harm, they cultivated, protected, and defended kinship networks. They engaged in a range of practices meant to safeguard their bodies and their legacies. At times this included legitimating kinship ties through formal sacred institutions like the Catholic Church.""",,"Powell, Lawrence N.. The Accidental City (pp. 268-269).

manumission,Manumission,manumission,"Manumission is the act of freeing and being freed from slavery ""while the institution of slavery continues,"" as described by Randy J. Sparks and Rosemary Brana-Shte. Manumission was a critical act and strategy enslaved people engaged in as they struggled for control over the lives, selves, and kinship networks. Differentiated from emancipation, which were legislative acts and actions (i.e. U.S. Civil War) wholesale or conditionally (i.e. with apprenticeship) freeing all enslaved people across a given slaveholding society, manumission was executed by individual enslavers on behalf of their respective property (enslaved people) through formal (i.e. legal) action. Manumission was regulated by imperial and national officials in all slaveholding societies, but the rules of manumission varied across empire, region, even towns or colonial outposts. In French Louisiana, manumission was regulated by a succession of Code Noirs (1685, 1724) which determined the guidelines enslavers needed to follow to complete an act of manumission. In Spanish Louisiana, the French ordinances were replaced by Spanish manumission law guided by the Siete Partidas, eighteenth-century Spanish imperial Code Noirs and bandos de buen gobierno. The differences were stark between the two imperial eras. For example, during the French period, enslavers were required to secure ratification of the Superior Council for any manumissions. In the Spanish period, not could enslavers directly manumit their enslaved property, but enslaved people could also appeal to the Spanish Cabildo (Louisiana's governing body during the Spanish period) for their freedom. Coartación, the process of appealing for your freedom, allowed a critical mass of Africans and people of African descent to secure their freedom. The audacity, creativity and resistance practice of enslaved people demanding their legal freedom from their owners through coartación, laid the foundation for the free population of color that would emerge in the later years of the eighteenth-century.

policing,Policing,policing,"As a keyword, Policing describes the methods used to enforce conditions like slavery, which also reflect colonial tendencies toward dehumanization. These methods include subjecting individuals to physical and mental control, as well as the threat of losing loved ones or of being in an unfamiliar place. Policing tactics also reflect the threat that many enslaved posed through their ability to develop ways to resist and to adapt to the changing conditions imposed upon them.

Gay, an enslaved man in the documents, recounts his experience of being forced to wear iron as he was transported over 100 miles and thirty four hours from New Orleans to Natchez.  His story attests to the types of violence that was used by enslavers, government functionaries, and others, to police enslaved and free people’s behavior. Whether personally subjected to this and other forms of violence, the threat of violence circulated widely among free and enslaved people. Despite this, archival documents provide evidence of the ability of people to create community, resist, and live. ",,,d0286,d0286,,,,,5/21/2024 12:27pm,,,

wellness,Wellness,wellness,"Keywords for Black Louisiana views ""wellness"" expansively and radically to encompass an array of practices. For Africans in Gulf Coast Louisiana, wellness meant more than the physical health. Enslavers demanded control over Africans bodies, minds, and futures (via their reproductive labor). Wellness, for Africans, meant wresting control of their whole selves from enslavers. Wellness could mean body autonomy (laboring as they wished, playing as they wished, imbibing food and drink as they wished). It could mean spiritual practices that protected and preserve African systems of belief or maintained  ways of organizing the supernatural that varied from Catholic doctrine. It could mean play, mischief, even behavior the French marked as crimes such as theft or running away, since these crimes often created space for broader wellness practices (feasts, gatherings, and marroonage). 

Along with misreading wellness practices as crimes, enslavers also misread wellness practices as superstition. In 1734, Le Page du Pratz, for example described the creation of gris-gris, protective devices composed of natural and inanimate materials, as being ""very superstitious and attached to their prejudices."" As Gwendolyn Midlo Hall notes, ""Reference to grigri is found in New Orleans court records in 1773. Charms ritually fabricated and worn for protection, as well as charms intended to harm others, have kept their African names to the present day. Zinzin, an amulet of support or power in Louisiana Creole, has the same name and meaning in Bambara. Grisgris, a harmful charm, comes from the Mande word gerregerys. The words zvanga and grisgris are still widely used in New Orleans by speakers of English as well as by Creoles.""

womanhood,Womanhood,womanhood,"Among Black/African women, Womanhood provided a shared space of connection. In eighteenth century Black Louisiana, womanhood was more than the adult stage of life that followed childhood. Rather, it was a space defined by the ability to see, create, and perform kinship across a diverse array of conditions. Like “Girlhood,” Womahood captured the experiences and struggles of women, as well as their efforts to resist and create autonomous spaces. Different than Girlhood, however, Womahood included a different set of abilities and vulnerabilities; for example, for enslaved women in particular, womanhood included the threat of losing loved ones and family members. In the documents, we see women share in Womahood in ways that also resist colonial violence and create strength through kinship and family; in the case of  Geneveva Junon and Maria Juana, two Black women negotiate the sale of property from one to the other.
