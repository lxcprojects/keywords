##### Leila Blackbird
(LA Kréyòl/Apache-Cherokee Descent) is the Pozen Family Human Rights Doctoral Fellow of U.S. & Atlantic History at the University of Chicago. Her dissertation, “Embodied Violence in the Shatter Zone: Settler Colonialism and Slavery on America’s Third Coast,” confronts the widespread enslavement of Native and Black-Native people, especially women and girls, in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region since European intrusion. Situated at the intersection of the historical processes of colonization, slavery, and global capitalist modernity, Leila’s work demonstrates how settler colonialism and state violence functions over time, continuing to impact human and civil rights today. Her work has appeared in *What is History, Now?, Louisiana Creole Peoplehood, and Eighteenth-Century Studies*, and she has a forthcoming article in *The William & Mary Quarterly*.
